# Roadmap  | Nginx
### **1. Foundations**
- **Understand the Basics:**
    - What is Nginx, and why use it?
    - Difference between Nginx and other web servers (e.g., Apache).
- **Installation:**
    - Install Nginx on various operating systems (Linux, Windows).
    - Understand directory structure and key files (`nginx.conf` , error logs, access logs).
---

### **2. Core Concepts**
- **HTTP Server Basics:**
    - Configure a simple static website.
    - Understand directives: `server` , `location` , `root` , `index` .
    - Serve multiple websites using server blocks.
- **Reverse Proxy:**
    - Set up Nginx as a reverse proxy.
    - Understand proxy headers (`X-Forwarded-For` , `X-Real-IP` ).
- **Load Balancing:**
    - Configure round-robin, least connections, and IP hash methods.
    - Explore health checks for backend servers.
---

### **3. Security**
- **HTTPS and SSL/TLS:**
    - Generate and configure SSL certificates using Letâ€™s Encrypt.
    - Set up HTTPS redirects and HTTP/2.
    - Understand SSL parameters (e.g., `ssl_protocols` , `ssl_ciphers` ).
- **Access Control:**
    - Restrict access using IP whitelisting/blacklisting.
    - Configure basic authentication.
- **Rate Limiting:**
    - Prevent DDoS attacks using rate-limiting modules.
- **WAF (Web Application Firewall):**
    - Integrate tools like ModSecurity or NAXSI.
---

### **4. Advanced Configuration**
- **Caching:**
    - Set up and tune caching (`proxy_cache` , `fastcgi_cache` ).
- **Compression:**
    - Enable Gzip and Brotli compression for optimized performance.
- **Logging and Monitoring:**
    - Customize access and error logs.
    - Integrate monitoring tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK stack.
- **Custom Modules:**
    - Learn to compile Nginx with custom modules.
    - Explore open-source and third-party modules.
---

### **5. Performance Optimization**
- **Tuning Parameters:**
    - Optimize worker processes and connections.
    - Adjust buffer sizes and timeouts.
- **Connection Management:**
    - Explore Keep-Alive and HTTP/2 optimizations.
- **Serving Static Files:**
    - Use features like `sendfile` , `tcp_nodelay` , and `tcp_nopush` .
---

### **6. Application Integrations**
- **Dynamic Content Handling:**
    - Set up FastCGI for PHP applications.
    - Integrate with application servers (e.g., Gunicorn, uWSGI).
- **Microservices:**
    - Use Nginx for service discovery and API gateway configurations.
- **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs):**
    - Configure Nginx for edge caching and CDN support.
---

### **7. High Availability**
- **Failover Setup:**
    - Configure active-passive and active-active setups.
- **Clustering:**
    - Use tools like Keepalived or HAProxy for redundancy.
- **Zero-Downtime Deployments:**
    - Implement blue-green and canary deployments.
---

### **8. Deep Dive into Nginx Internals**
- **Master Configuration Syntax:**
    - Learn advanced regex in `location`  blocks.
    - Understand inheritance and precedence.
- **Debugging:**
    - Use `debug`  logs and troubleshoot common errors.
- **Compile from Source:**
    - Learn to build Nginx with custom modules and patches.
---

### **9. Real-World Projects**
- Host multiple websites with different configurations.
- Configure a complex API gateway for a microservices architecture.
- Set up a streaming server using Nginx RTMP module.
- Optimize a high-traffic application for scalability.
---

### **10. Continuous Learning**
- **Community and Resources:**
    - Follow Nginx documentation and changelogs.
    - Join communities like Nginx forums, Reddit, or Stack Overflow.
- **Certifications:**
    - Pursue Nginx certifications if available.
- **Open Source Contributions:**
    - Contribute to the Nginx open-source project or related modules.
